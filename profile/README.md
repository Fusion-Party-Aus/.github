## 🏛️ Our History

Fusion Party Australia was formed in **2021** through an amalgamation of five experienced political parties:

- **Science Party** — Evidence-based policy and innovation
- **Pirate Party** — Digital rights and civil liberties
- **Secular Party** — Separation of church and state
- **Vote Planet** — Environmental and climate action
- **Climate Change Justice Party** — Climate emergency response

These parties, each with specialized expertise, fused to create something more powerful than the sum of their parts. The constituent parties had been contesting elections since **2010** and collectively won **76,861 votes** across 4 states in the 2019 federal election.

### Electoral History

- **2022** — First federal election as Fusion: 19 candidates across NSW, QLD, SA, WA, and VIC
- **2023** — Owen Miller contested the Aston by-election
- **2025** — 22 candidates in federal election across 5 states

## 🗳️ Why Vote for a Minor Party First?

Australia's **preferential voting** system means your vote is never wasted. If your first choice is eliminated, your vote flows to your next preference. This lets you:

✅ **Signal what you want changed** — Tell major parties you want cannabis legalised, stronger climate action, or evidence-based policy  
✅ **Keep your safety net** — Your vote still counts for Labor or Liberal in the final round  
✅ **Create momentum** — More people voting for new ideas forces major parties to adopt them  

**Your #1 vote is your loudest voice. Use it to demand the Australia you want to see.**

## 🌏 Climate Rescue Accord

Fusion is a signatory to the [**Climate Rescue Accord**](https://www.climaterescue.net/) — a cross-party initiative committed to:

- **Net negative emissions** — Removing more carbon than we emit
- **Active cooling** — Reflecting solar heat to stabilize temperatures
- **Evidence-based targets** — Following science, not political compromise

We believe in solutions that **reverse global heating**, not just slow it down.
